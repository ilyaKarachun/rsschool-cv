*My nickname on Discord.com Ilya_Karachun*

I live in Minsk but ready for relocate. I learn IT since February. Start my way with Yandex.Praktikum, WEB-development.
At Yandex.Practicum I got to know HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. I finished my course with three project. All my projects I
made by myself, using Figma and documentation for project.
First one was basic landing without adaptive but on FLex. U could only reading and enjoy small animation.
Better watch it on laptop:

The second project was really hard as first *"real"* project. Here u can see adaptive, Flex and Grid, high level of CSS:

On the third project made on vanilla JS. Task was made little page where person can add card with favourite place, give
likes, but it's without connection to server(So shade). U can try this:

homeworks, almost all-time support, lectures, exams and so on. On the course we make three little project on React.
U can watch one of them. It's "ToDoList". Here u can make list of ur tasks on a day. It's not finished yet. But here the
